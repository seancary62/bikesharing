# bikesharing


## Overview
In this analyis we looked at 2018 bike sharing data from Citibike and created seveal visualizations wih Tableau. The Tableau story could be use to show hypothetical investors whether or not a bike sharing system would work for Des Moines.

## Results

## Summary:

From the tables above we can draw a few conclusions:

1. Men are the most frequent users.
2. Men and women use the bikes areound the same time. 
3. Most trips start from 4-8pm, with a spike from 8-9am.
4. Most riders are subscribers.
5. The vast majority of trips are under 1 hour.

Before saying that this a bike sharing system would work for Des Moines, there are few other items that we should look at. Age would be a good demographic to consider, as it may be the case that a particular age group is more accepting of bike sharing. A bar plot of rides by birth year, broken into 5 year increments, may provide more insight into user demographics. Further more, a "user by birth year by gender" heatmap could give more insight into what age group of females are more likely to use the bikes and where the company should target advertising to increase diversity.  Aside from these additional model, it would also be helpful to compare avergae age groups and gender distributions of each city side by side. One positive note is that most of the users tend to be subscribers, which would suggest that mostly locals are using the service and not NYC tourists.
